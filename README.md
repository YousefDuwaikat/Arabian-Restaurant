press on the TOTAL button after choosing what you want, then press on the RECEIPT button to get the receipt on the left side

There are two additional forms: one named FORM4.CS, which was created to thank people for choosing our restaurant,
and the last one named Order.cs for those who want to place another order. However, I didn't connect them as they are not that important.
